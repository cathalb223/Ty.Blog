                            <p>I first applied for the Redhat TY programme quite early on in the year and was surprised when I got an email two weeks ago to tell me that I got into it. 
                                I have had an interest in coding for awhile, every since I joined my local coderdojo. I have mainly done C++ with a little bit of html and javascript sprinkled in.
                                I have also been looking at computer sciences as a potential college course for the future. </p>
                            <p>My experience so far has been quite positive, I enjoy the relaxed nature of the employees and how the business is ran. I am really impressed by the general facilities that are available and could
                                definitely see myself working here and enjoying it if given the oppurtunity. The speakers have all been really good and informative and I am happy to learn more about how all this works.

                                On the first day, as shown above, we had a welcome talk, introducing us to Red Hat and doing an ice breaker. We played a game where we would have a paper taped to our backs
                                with the name of a famous person on them, we would then have to ask questions to other people to figure out which famous person we had. Then we had an office tour with Becky.
                                After lunch we had a GIT workshop where we found out how to edit code and use Github to store commits. On Tuesday we had a talk on Agile, a method of software development meant 
                                to increase quality and reduce burnout in teams. Then we had a talk on Microbits, small circuitboards
                                that can be programmed with either block codes or python.
                            </p>

                                 I am writing this on Wednesday morning, so we haven't done any other activities yet, but I am excited to do Teambuilding with Lego and the teamwork challenge at the end of the day.
                                 Learning more about the day to day of a software engineer and student life will also be quite interesting I am sure. On Thursday we have a big meeting where everyone is touching
                                 base and we have to introduce ourselves with an interesting fact about ourselves and then we are getting breakfast. I am excited for the Python talk, as I don't know too much about
                                 that coding language. The final day has robot programming, which is something that I am quite familiar with, so I hope I will be good at it.
